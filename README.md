2 - Configure the environment: Install the tools and dependencies required for the project.

3 - Run the application: Use the specific commands to start the application.

## What areas of the app did you focus on?
Data presentation, readable code and architecture

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
Display a list of nodes with a large amount of data.
Organize the list layout to display all information in an intuitive and readable way.

## How long did you spend on this project?
Taking into account everything from creating the project, configuring the dependencies and tools, choosing the icons and layout, I spent around 12 hours.

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
I added icons to improve the display of data, and I adjusted the way dates and times were displayed to reduce the amount of information in the list.

With more time, I thought about:
- Copying the public key with a tap on the text
- Replacing the country name with the corresponding flag
- Displaying an AlertDialog when a node is selected to display additional information, thus removing some information from the list.
- Creating a sorting option based on specific information such as: Capacity, Channels, creation and update date.
- Adding the position number of each node.
- Add a search by node name (alias)

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The error handling part coming from the API could be standardized and separated from the verifications and test coverage.The error handling part coming from the API could be standardized and separated from the verifications and test coverage.

## Is there any other information you’d like us to know?
I believe I mentioned it in the topic about future improvements
